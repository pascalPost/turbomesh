# turbomesh

An automated mesher for turbomachinery applications (written in rust).

Development roadmap:
- [x] 2D linear tfi
- [ ] elliptic block smoothing
- [ ] elliptic mesh smoothing (multiple blocks including inter-block boundaries)
- [ ] automated blocking for turbomachinery
- [ ] extension to 3D based on meshed 2d cuts
- [ ] possible extension to radial configurations
